# ALU test script
This test script is to test the ALU to see if it is working as intended as well as making sure every part is throwing back the expected test results.
If you wish to access the ALU with the test scripts and the complete circuit board, please contact me at tristaneberger@gmail.com or message my github so that I can show you it. I am not at liberty to release the whole project to the public due to my professor okaying certain protions of the project.
